Some concurrency tests for java.util.concurrent and other classes, mainly from an "understanding" standpoint.

Introduction
============

Concurrency is hard. Testing concurrent programs is harder. But perhaps it's easier to understand that concurrency 
is hard if you write tests for concurrency classes. Doug Lea's tck for JSR 166 is execellent, but these are some independent
tests that I have decided to write. Maybe I will understanding concurrency better that way?
